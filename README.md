# NHATS-Clock-Drawing-CNN
This repository implements a **supervised deep learning pipeline** for classifying **NHATS Round 11 Clock Drawing Test (CDT) images** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in PyTorch. The goal is to predict cognitive status using **clock drawing images combined with NHATS clinical labels**.
